Replaces the admin menu icons of WordPress 2.7 with a mixture of Firefox, GNOME and Tango icons.

==  Description ==

Tangofy does three simple things for now:

*   Replaces the 16×16 menu icons in the administration area of WordPress 2.7 with a mixture of Firefox, GNOME and Tango icons.
*   Dispenses with the Black & White subset.  All link states have fully coloured icons.
*   Hides the 32×32 icons.

The Firefox, GNOME, and Tango icons are from the sites of the three projects:

*   [http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/](http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/)
*   [http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/desktop/](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/desktop/)
*   [http://tango.freedesktop.org/](http://tango.freedesktop.org/)

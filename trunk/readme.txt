Better icons for the admin menu of WordPress 2.7:  select an included icon set (Fugue, Silk, Tango, Tango 2) or add your own!

==  Description ==

Tangofy does three simple things:

*   Replaces the 16×16 menu icons in the administration area of WordPress 2.7 with better icons!  Choose an included set —1 Fugue set, 1 Silk set, 2 Tango sets— or use your own icons!
*   Dispenses with Black & White icons.  All link states have full colour.
*   Hides the 32×32 icons.

And it can speak any language you ask it to!  It already speaks English and Greek.  

The Tango icon sets use icons from four projects:  GIMP, GNOME, Pidgin and Tango.  Silk uses Silk Icons.  Fugue uses Fugue Icons.

Better icons for the admin menu of WordPress 2.7:  select an included icon set (Fugue, Silk, Tango, Tango 2) or add your own!

==  Description ==

Tangofy does three things:

*   Replaces the menu icons in the administration area of WordPress 2.7 with better, *more helpful* icons.  Either an included set—2 Fugue sets, 1 Silk, 2 Tango—or your own!
*   Dispenses with Black & White icons.  All link states have full colour.
*   Hides the large 32×32 icons.  (Or shows them, if you prefer.)

And speaks six languages:

*   English (default)
*   Greek, by Demetris
*   Polish, by x600.
*   Portuguese (Brazilian), by Fernando Lopes ([fernandolopes.com.br](http://www.fernandolopes.com.br/))
*   Spanish, by Federico Bond ([federicobond.com.ar](http://www.federicobond.com.ar/))
*   Turkish, by Semih Aksu ([wpuzmani.com](http://www.wpuzmani.com/))

The Tango sets use icons from 4 projects:  GIMP, GNOME, Pidgin and Tango.  Silk uses Silk Icons.  Fugue uses Fugue Icons.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does “Tangofy” mean? =

“To tangofy something”, usually an application, means to make new icons for it, or to add icons to it, that follow the guidelines of the Tango Desktop Project.  The first versions of Tangofy —0.0.0 up to 0.0.6— were just that:  One set of Tango-style icons to improve the admin menu of WordPress 2.7.  Hence the name.

Tangofy adds better icons to the admin menu of WordPress 2.7:  Select from the include icon sets (Fugue, Silk, Tango, Tango 2) or add your own!

==  Description ==

Tangofy does three simple things:

*   Replaces the 16×16 menu icons in the administration area of WordPress 2.7 with better icon sets:  either an included set —1 Fugue set, 1 Silk set, 2 Tango sets— or your own!
*   Dispenses with Black & White icons.  All link states have full colour.
*   Hides the 32×32 icons.

The Tango sets are put together with icons from four projects:  GIMP, GNOME, Pidgin, and Tango.  The Silk set uses Silk Icons.  The Fugue set uses Fugue Icons:

*   [ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/desktop](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/desktop/)
*   [gimp.org](http://gimp.org/)
*   [pidgin.im](http://pidgin.im/)
*   [tango.freedesktop.org](http://tango.freedesktop.org/)
*   [www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/) (Silk Icons)
*   [www.pinvoke.com](http://www.pinvoke.com/) (Fugue Icons)

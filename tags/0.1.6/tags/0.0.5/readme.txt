Replaces the admin menu icons of WordPress 2.7 with a mixture of Firefox, GNOME and Tango icons.

== Description ==

Tangofy does three simple things:

* Replaces the 16×16 menu icons in the administration area of WordPress 2.7 with a mixture of Firefox, GNOME and Tango icons.
* Dispenses with the Black & White subset.  All link states have fully coloured icons.
* Hides the 32×32 icons.

The Firefox, GNOME, and Tango icons are used unaltered and can be found at the sites of the three projects:

* [http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/](http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/) for the Firefox icons
* [http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/desktop/](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/desktop/) for the GNOME icons
* [http://tango.freedesktop.org/](http://tango.freedesktop.org/) for the Tango icons
